Understanding the basics of ggsyntax\n\nAccording to the [tidyverse documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html), the function ggplot() initializes a ggplot object. It can be used to declare the input data frame for a graphic and to specify the set of plot aesthetics intended to be common throughout all subsequent layers unless specifically overridden.\n<br>\n<br>\nggplot() is used to construct the initial plot object, and is almost always followed by + to add components to the plot.\n<br>\n<br>\nNow, let's dissect a ggplot. In the line of code below, the first, non-optional argument of ggplot() is the dataframe to be used. This is followed by the aesthetics aes() function which be used to construct the aesthetic mappings.

Importantly, as you can see, the fill in geom_bar overrides the fill in the aes() function; in doing so, it superimposes the color *steelblue* over the colors that would have differentiated both genders. In this case, which fill do you think would be more informative?\n\n**In all, the most important lesson to take away from here is the following: everything you write *inside* aes() references variables and is based on data, while everything *outside* aes() are aesthetic parameters that make the plot pretty.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ggplot(data, aes(x= gender, fill= gender))+ # plot gender by color\ngeom_bar(fill= \"steelblue\") # override, make it a steel blue bar graph","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"graph_customization\"></a>\n## 3. Graph customization\n\nIn this section of the notebook, I will employ bar plots,given that they are some of the most common graphs across disciplines, to exemplify a lot of different modifications that can be made to plots. In further sections, I will be explaining how to make other types of plots as well but, for now, let's stick to bar plots.\n\nRemember, we will be building our plots iteratively, that is, adding layer after layer little by little. I suggest you do this because, if you run into problems, you will know exactly where you messed up, since you're building plots step by step.\n\nIn all we will cover the following aspects of graph customization:\n* Colors\n* Legends\n* Axes\n* Text\n* Themes\n* Faceting\n* Saving\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"colors\"></a>\n### Colors\nColoring plots is almost an art form, that's why there is so much information out there on colors and palettes for ggplot2.

One of the most popular ones is the [Brewer palette](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3), though there are many others.\n<br>\n<br>\nNow let's put colors into practice, here are some examples:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Plotting race group by math score grouped colored by gender\nggplot(data, aes(x= race, y=math, fill=gender))+ # must include fill in aes()\ngeom_bar(stat= \"identity\")+ \nscale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#CC6666\", \"#66CC99\"))+# color with number\nggtitle(\"Graph 1\")\n\n# Note: you can see that R automatically knows to stack this bar plot to reflect gender differences","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# First install the package\ninstall.packages(\"RColorBrewer\")\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\n# Plotting race group by math score colored by race group\nggplot(data, aes(x= race, y=math, fill=race))+  # must include fill in aes()\ngeom_bar(stat= \"identity\")+\nscale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Set1\")+ # color with palette\nggtitle(\"Graph 2\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In all, we have seen that there are several ways in which can color ggplot graphs both from inside and outside the aes() function depending on what we want to convey.
