<h1 align="center"> ggplot2 Deep Dive </h1>

In this repository, I will be taking a deep dive into the syntaxt of ggplot2. While there are many resources to learn the ins and outs of ggplot2, they are scattered all over the web. The goal of this repopsitory is to synthhesize and add to these resources in a single site.

Throughout upcomingo versions of this repository, I will build on gpplot2 graphs iteratively to progressively create more complex and complete data visualizations.
